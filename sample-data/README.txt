Sample data to test the UKF:

- lookAt1: short rotation around landmarks' cloud (zero motion noise, but 0.1 std pixel noise).
- lookAt2: path towards the landmarks' cloud (zero motion noise, but 0.1 std pixel noise).
- lookAt3: path towards the landmarks' cloud (zero motion noise, but 0.1 std pixel noise).
- lookAt4: long circular path around the landmarks' cloud (zero motion noise, but 0.1 std pixel noise).
- lookAt5: path around landmarks' cloud (0.1 std accel, gyro and pixel noise)
- lookAt6: path around landmarks' with extra noise for the spline, so it's not contained in a plane (0.1 std accel, gyro and pixel noise)
